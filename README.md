**Overview**
<p>This project simulates a burger restaurant environment where customers are processed through billing counters and burgers are prepared on a griddle. The simulation calculates various statistics like average waiting time and queue lengths to help improve customer service.</p>

**Problem Statement**
<p>McMahon's Burgers in this scenario is a popular restaurant with multiple billing counters and a busy kitchen. Customers arrive randomly and choose the billing queue with the shortest length. Each billing specialist processes orders at a rate proportional to their counter number. After billing, orders are sent to the chef, who cooks burgers on a large griddle.</p>

**Key Features:**
 1. Customers join the shortest billing queue.
 2. Billing specialists have varying efficiencies.
 3. Burgers are cooked in batches on the griddle.
 4. Statistics like average waiting time and queue lengths are calculated.

**Features**
 1. Queue Management: Efficient handling of customer queues using heaps and queues.
 2. Simulation: Event-driven simulation of customer arrivals, order processing, and burger preparation.
 3. Performance Metrics: Calculation of customer wait times, average wait time, and griddle state.

**Development**
<p>This project uses Java and requires implementing data structures like heaps, queues, and arrays.</p>
